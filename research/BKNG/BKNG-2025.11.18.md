# Booking Holdings (BKNG) - LONG - 12-18mo

**Fair Value:** $6,310 (prob-weighted) | **Current:** $5,048 | **Upside:** 25% | **Conviction:** High

## 1. Thesis & Expectations Gap

We recommend a **LONG** position in Booking Holdings (BKNG). Despite being the dominant global OTA with an 86% ROIC, BKNG trades at ~18.6x forward earnings—a discount to slower-growing consumer staples and peers. The market misinterprets the strategic shift to the "Merchant" model (now 68% of bookings) as margin-dilutive, failing to appreciate that it unlocks the "Connected Trip" strategy, driving higher Life Time Value (LTV) and cementing a structural moat that competitors cannot replicate without massive capital destruction.

**Market Expectation:** At $5,048 (22x FY25E P/E), the market is pricing in:
- **Deceleration:** Revenue growth fading to 6-7% annually, implying travel demand has peaked post-COVID.
- **Margin Compression:** Concerns that the mix-shift to Merchant (payments) and flight offerings will permanently depress FCF margins below historical 30%+ levels.
- **Competitive Fade:** Share loss to Airbnb in alternative accommodations and Google in search.

**Our Variant View:** We believe the market significantly underestimates the **durability of growth** and **unit economics** of the Connected Trip. Our analysis suggests:
- **Resilient Growth:** Revenue CAGR of 11% through 2028, driven by Asia-Pacific recovery and share gains in the US alternative accommodation market (listings +10% YoY).
- **Structural Margins:** While gross margins compress optically due to merchant accounting, **EBITDA dollars per booking** are expanding due to AI-driven efficiency (customer service costs down) and direct mix increasing (Genius loyalty members now >55% of room nights).
- **Capital Return:** The market ignores the massive buyback yield. BKNG has reduced share count by ~14% since 2022, accelerating EPS growth well above revenue growth.

**Valuation Summary:** Our probability-weighted fair value of **$6,310** implies **25% upside**, based on a DCF analysis assuming a base case of 10% revenue CAGR and sustained 30% FCF margins. See Section 6 for full methodology.

## 2. Source of Edge (BAIT)

**Primary Edge: Analytical**

The market is committing a **denominator error** regarding the shift to the Merchant model. Investors historically valued BKNG on its high-margin Agency model (customer pays hotel, hotel pays BKNG commission). As BKNG shifts to Merchant (customer pays BKNG, BKNG pays hotel), revenue increases (gross basis) but operating margins % fall, scaring margin-focused algorithms.

**The Reality:** This shift allows BKNG to:
1.  **Control the Price:** Offer merchandising/discounting to opaque users (Genius).
2.  **Bundle:** Cross-sell flights/cars (Connected Trip), which have lower margins but zero Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) when attached to a hotel.
3.  **Capture Fintech Yield:** FX spread and payments revenue.

**Evidence:** Despite the Merchant mix rising from 61% to 68% YoY in Q3 2025, Adjusted EBITDA dollars grew **15%**, outpacing revenue growth of 13%. The "margin compression" thesis is false in dollar terms. The moat is widening because smaller OTAs cannot replicate this fintech/payments infrastructure (a multi-billion dollar annual spend).

## 3. Linchpins (2-3 Key Drivers)

**Linchpin 1: Room Night Growth & Direct Mix**
- **Our View:** Room nights grow 7-8% CAGR; Direct mix reaches 60% by 2026.
- **Market View:** Room nights grow 4-5% (GDP levels); Google reliance remains high.
- **Rationale:** "Genius" loyalty program is a self-reinforcing loop. Level 2/3 users (high frequency) grew to >30% of active base. Higher direct mix creates operating leverage on marketing spend (marketing % of Gross Bookings fell 30bps YoY in Q3).

**Linchpin 2: Alternative Accommodation (Home) Share**
- **Our View:** 15% growth in alternative room nights, outpacing core hotels.
- **Market View:** Airbnb dominates; BKNG is a distant second.
- **Rationale:** BKNG is unique in offering *both* hotels and homes in one search. This "indifferent" supply aggregates demand better than niche platforms. Q3 alternative inventory grew rapidly, showing supply-side buy-in.

## 4. Signposts & Falsification

| Signpost | Timeframe | Our Probability | Consensus |
|----------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| Room Night Growth >7% YoY | Q4 2025 | 75% | 6% |
| Marketing as % of Gross Bookings <4.8% | FY 2025 | 80% | 5.0% |
| Share Count <31.5M | Q1 2026 | 90% | 32.0M |

**Invalidation criteria:**
- **Marketing deleverage:** Marketing spend growing faster than Gross Bookings for 2 consecutive quarters (indicates CAC pressure).
- **ROIC degradation:** ROIC falling below 30% (currently >80%), signaling "diworsification" into low-quality verticals without cross-sell benefits.

## 5. Pre-Mortem & Risks

For thesis to be wrong:

1.  **Regulatory Crackdown (DMA)**: EU Digital Markets Act forces data decoupling, breaking the "Connected Trip" funnel.
    - **Probability:** 25%
    - **Mitigation:** BKNG has operated under strict EU scrutiny for a decade; growth is increasingly driven by US and Asia (less reg pressure).
2.  **AI Disintermediation**: Google/OpenAI launch a direct "travel agent" that bypasses OTAs.
    - **Probability:** 15% (Near term)
    - **Mitigation:** Travel requires real-time inventory/payments execution, not just information. BKNG's supply relationships (millions of hotels) are the bottleneck AI cannot hallucinate.

## 6. Fair Value Analysis

**Primary Valuation Method:** Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)
*We prioritize DCF because BKNG is a mature compounder where cash flow durability matters more than short-term multiples.*

**Key Assumptions:**
- **WACC:** 9.0% (Base rate for volatile consumer discretionary).
- **FCF Conversion:** 30% of Revenue (Consistent with TTM conversion of ~30% and high quality of earnings).
- **Share Count:** Aggressive reduction (-4% annually) via buybacks using robust FCF.

**Scenario Analysis:**

| Scenario | Probability | Key Assumptions | Fair Value |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| Bear | 25% | 4% Rev CAGR (Recession/Regs), 25% FCF Margin, 10% WACC | $3,950 |
| Base | 50% | 10% Rev CAGR (Share gains), 30% FCF Margin, 9% WACC | $6,305 |
| Bull | 25% | 14% Rev CAGR (AI efficiency), 33% FCF Margin, 8.5% WACC | $8,680 |

**Probability-Weighted Fair Value:** $6,310
**Implied Return:** +25% from current price of $5,048

**Valuation Bridge (Base Case):**
- **PV of 5-Year FCF:** $51.2B
- **PV of Terminal Value:** $168.5B (3% terminal growth)
- **Enterprise Value:** $219.7B
- **Add Net Cash:** $16.5B (Cash) - $18.9B (Debt) = ($2.4B) *Conservatively treating as net debt despite massive cash pile due to float dynamics*
- **Equity Value:** $217.3B
- **Shares Outstanding:** 32.2M (Current) → **Target: ~$6,748 (Base Case unweighted)**

*Note: The probability-weighted target ($6,310) builds in a 25% chance of a "Bear" scenario where growth stalls, providing a margin of safety.*

## 7. Supporting Data

### Valuation & Efficiency

| Metric | Current (BKNG) | Expedia (EXPE) | Airbnb (ABNB) |
|--------|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| P/E (FY25E) | 22.2x | 11.5x | 28.0x |
| ROIC | 86.8% | 8.5% | 35% |
| FCF Yield | ~5.0% | ~8.0% | ~3.5% |

*BKNG commands a premium to EXPE due to superior execution/ROIC, but trades at a discount to ABNB despite having better margins and a growing home rental business.*

### Recent Performance (Q3 2025)

| Metric | Value | YoY | vs Consensus |
|--------|-------|-----|--------------|
| Gross Bookings | $50.0B | +14% | Beat (+4pp) |
| Revenue | $9.0B | +13% | Beat |
| Adj. EBITDA | $4.2B | +15% | Beat (+6pp) |
| Room Nights | 323M | +8% | Beat (+3pp) |

### Management Commentary

> "Travelers in Genius Levels 2 and 3 made up over 30% of our active base and accounted for a mid-50% range of our room nights... increasingly booking directly."
> — *Glenn Fogel, CEO, Q3 2025 Earnings Call*

> "We are raising our expectation for the ultimate annual run-rate savings to a range of $500 to $550 million... driven by AI and operational efficiency."
> — *Ewout Steenbergen, CFO, Q3 2025 Earnings Call*

### Forecast vs Consensus

| Metric | FY25E (Ours) | FY25E (Cons) | FY26E (Ours) | FY26E (Cons) |
|--------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Revenue ($B) | $27.5 | $27.1 | $30.5 | $29.6 |
| EPS ($) | $232.00 | $227.48 | $275.00 | $269.41 |

**Key Differences:** We are more bullish on **EBITDA flow-through** from the "Merchant" shift. Consensus models linear margin degradation; we model flat-to-rising *dollar* margins per booking as AI reduces customer service headcount.
