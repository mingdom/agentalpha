## Thesis Validation Matrix

### ✅ THESIS CONFIRMED (Neutral Stance Correct)

**Conditions:**
- Q4 guidance: $52-54B (in-line)
- Data Center GM: 74-76% (modest mix shift)
- FCF conversion: ≥85%
- Commentary: Balanced (demand strong, but supply/China watched closely)

**Action:** Hold current position, wait for FY27 guidance (Feb 2026)

---

### 🟢 THESIS INVALIDATED → BULLISH

**Conditions:**
- Q4 guidance: ≥$55B with "unconstrained supply"
- Data Center GM: ≥77%
- FCF conversion: ≥90%
- Commentary: Sovereign AI accelerating, Blackwell demand exceeds expectations

**Action:** Cover shorts, consider tactical 3-6 month long
**Rationale:** Cycle duration extends beyond our base case, near-term upside to $210-220

---

### 🔴 THESIS INVALIDATED → BEARISH

**Conditions:**
- Q4 guidance: ≤$51B OR supply constraints mentioned
- Data Center GM: ≤73%
- FCF conversion: <80% (ex one-time items)
- Commentary: Cautious on timing, China recovery delayed, capex moderation signals

**Action:** Initiate/add to short position
**Rationale:** Base rate mean reversion arriving sooner than expected, target $165 (12mo)

---

## Conference Call Watch List

### Key Questions to Track:

**On Cycle Duration:**
- [ ] How many quarters of Blackwell backlog visibility?
- [ ] Any hyperscaler capex pause signals or "digestion" language?
- [ ] FY27 growth trajectory commentary?

**On Margins:**
- [ ] Blackwell ASP dynamics vs Hopper?
- [ ] Networking mix impact on margins?
- [ ] China H20 pricing commentary?

**On Competition:**
- [ ] AMD MI300 competitive impact?
- [ ] Custom silicon (TPU, Trainium) take-rate?
- [ ] CUDA Ecosystem Strength?

**On Demand Diversification:**
- [ ] CSP concentration (Big 4) trending down from 45%?
- [ ] Sovereign AI pipeline and timing?
- [ ] Enterprise adoption of Blackwell?

## Post-Earnings Action Items

1. **Fill out scorecard within 30 minutes of earnings release**
2. **Listen to conference call for qualitative signals**

## Base Rate Reminder

> "Can NVDA sustain 35-40% FCF margins at $200B+ revenue scale for 5+ years?"

**Historical Precedent:** Companies with >30% ROIC regress to 15-20% within 3-5 years.

**Current Valuation:** Market prices $194B perpetual FCF vs $60-70B current run-rate (3x gap).

**Key Question:** Does Q4 guidance extend the cycle 12-18 months (bullish) or signal normalization beginning (bearish)?
