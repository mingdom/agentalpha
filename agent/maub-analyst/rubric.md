# Investment Scoring Rubric
**Mandatory for All Equity Research**

## Philosophy

We score investments, not companies. A great business at the wrong price is a poor investment. Each position must demonstrate a **quantifiable expectations gap** between market pricing and fundamental reality.

## Scoring Framework

Six dimensions, each 0-10 (decimals allowed). Total /60, converted to /10 for final score.

### 1. Economic Moat (Quality)

**Test:** Can a well-funded competitor replicate this advantage in <5 years?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 9-10 | Unassailable (regulatory monopoly, network effects + high switching costs, proprietary data/IP) |
| 7-8 | Wide moat (one dominant factor: brand, scale economies, customer lock-in) |
| 5-6 | Narrow moat (temporary cost advantage, niche positioning) |
| 0-4 | No moat (commodity, easily replicable) |

### 2. Growth Durability (Visibility)

**Test:** How many years of demand are contractually/structurally visible?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 9-10 | 20%+ revenue CAGR highly probable for 5+ years (backlog + structural tailwind) |
| 7-8 | 12-20% CAGR for 3+ years with clear demand drivers |
| 5-6 | 5-12% CAGR or moderate cyclicality |
| 0-4 | Low single-digit growth or highly cyclical/uncertain |

**Mandatory:** State the specific demand driver (not "secular tailwind" - be specific: "migration from X to Y", "regulatory mandate", "installed base renewal")

### 3. Expectations Gap (Upside Potential)

**Test:** What % upside exists between current price and your base-case fair value?

| Score | Upside to FV | Implied |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| 9-10 | ≥50% | Severe mispricing |
| 7-8 | 25-50% | Material mispricing |
| 5-6 | 10-25% | Modest opportunity |
| 0-4 | <10% | Fairly valued or overvalued |

**Mandatory:** Explicitly state what growth/margin assumptions the current price requires (reverse DCF). Then show why your forecast differs.

### 4. Balance Sheet & Capital Efficiency

**Test:** Could the company survive 3 years of zero revenue with existing cash/credit?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 9-10 | Net cash fortress + FCF covers growth capex + aggressive buybacks/dividends |
| 7-8 | Investment grade, FCF positive, disciplined capital allocation |
| 5-6 | Levered but manageable, inconsistent FCF conversion |
| 0-4 | Over-levered, chronic dilution, poor capital allocation history |

### 5. Management & Execution

**Test:** Have they consistently turned high ROIC projects into shareholder value?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 9-10 | Decade+ track record of superior capital allocation + transparent communication + aligned incentives |
| 7-8 | Consistently meets/beats guidance, rational M&A, insider ownership |
| 5-6 | Mixed track record, occasional missteps, adequate disclosure |
| 0-4 | Poor capital allocation, governance concerns, frequent guide-downs |

**Evidence required:** Specific ROIC trends, M&A success rate, history of guidance vs. actuals.

### 6. Downside Risk & Fragility

**Test:** What are the 2 most credible paths to permanent 80%+ loss?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 9-10 | Minimal risk (oligopoly + net cash + recession-resistant + no disruption threat) |
| 7-8 | Moderate risk (cyclical exposure or regulatory uncertainty, but diversified) |
| 5-6 | Elevated risk (single customer/product, tech disruption threat, high leverage) |
| 0-4 | Existential threats plausible within 5 years (disruption, bankruptcy, terminal decline) |

**Mandatory:** Articulate the 2-3 most likely failure modes and assign probabilities.

## Final Score & Recommendations

| Total /60 | Score /10 | Action | Conviction |
|-----------|-----------|--------|------------|
| 54-60 | 9.0-10.0 | **Strong Long** | High confidence, material position size |
| 48-53 | 8.0-8.9 | **Long** | Moderate conviction, standard size |
| 42-47 | 7.0-7.9 | **Hold / Watch** | Marginal opportunity, small/no position |
| 36-41 | 6.0-6.9 | **Avoid** | Poor risk/reward |
| <36 | <6.0 | **Short Candidate** | Overvalued or structurally challenged |

## Documentation Requirements

Every research report must include:

**Scoring Summary Table:**
```
| Dimension | Score | Justification (1 sentence) |
|-----------|-------|----------------------------|
| Moat | X.X | [Why] |
| Growth | X.X | [Why] |
| Expectations Gap | X.X | [Why] |
| Balance Sheet | X.X | [Why] |
| Management | X.X | [Why] |
| Risk | X.X | [Why] |
| **TOTAL** | **X.X/10** | **[Recommendation]** |
```

**Fair Value Analysis:**
- Bear case price: $XXX (probability: XX%)
- Base case price: $XXX (probability: XX%)
- Bull case price: $XXX (probability: XX%)
- Probability-weighted FV: $XXX

**Edge Statement:**
One paragraph explicitly stating your primary edge (Behavioral/Analytical/Informational/Technical) and why the market is wrong.

## Rubric Discipline

1. **Apply consistently** - This rubric has been back-tested on our research history and codifies our qualitative judgment
2. **No score inflation** - A 9+ should be rare (top decile opportunities)
3. **Document deviations** - Any override requires Research Director approval with written rationale
4. **Update quarterly** - Re-score active positions as new data emerges

**Remember:** Consistency beats brilliance. Process over outcome. We get paid for finding mispricings, not validating good businesses at any price.
