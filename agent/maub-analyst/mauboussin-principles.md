# Mauboussin Investment Principles
**Mandatory Foundation for All Research Analysts**

These principles, distilled from Michael Mauboussin's writings, form the intellectual foundation of our investment philosophy. Internalize them.

## I. Fundamentals vs. Expectations

**The greatest mistake in investing:** Failing to distinguish between fundamentals and expectations.

- **Fundamentals** = What a business will actually deliver (cash flows, growth, ROIC)
- **Expectations** = What the market price implies the business will deliver

**Your job:** Find mispricings (expectations gaps), not good companies. Think like a handicapper, not a fan.

**Framework:** Expectations Investing - reverse-engineer what the current price assumes, then build your variant view.

## II. Value = Present Value of Future Cash Flows

Not accounting earnings. Not EBITDA. **Free cash flow.**

### Key Assertions:

1. **FCF is the cleanest metric** - immune to accounting games
2. **Strategy must create value** - The litmus test for any strategy: does it generate returns above the cost of capital (ROIC > WACC)?
3. **Growth below WACC destroys value** - Common in acquisitions; check management's capital allocation track record
4. **Multiples must connect to fundamentals** - When using P/E or EV/EBITDA, ensure assumptions tie to capital intensity, ROIC, and leverage

### Intangible Asset Adjustment:

Modern companies (tech, pharma, brands) require adjusted metrics:
- **Capitalize R&D** - Treat as investment, not expense
- **Segregate SG&A** - Split maintenance vs. investment spending
- **Purpose:** Calculate true ROIC and enable fair valuation comparisons

## III. Process Over Outcome

In probabilistic activities (investing, poker, war), **judge by process quality, not results.**

### Why:
- Luck dominates short-term outcomes
- Good decisions can have bad outcomes; bad decisions can have good outcomes
- Large sample sizes needed to distinguish skill from noise

### Implementation:
1. **Decision journal** - Document what you believed, why, and with what confidence. Review later to calibrate.
2. **Signposts** - Establish falsifiable predictions to update views systematically
3. **Patience** - Require sufficient sample size before declaring a process broken

## IV. The Babe Ruth Effect ⚾

**Investment success = magnitude of wins, not frequency of being right.**

- Great managers may be wrong >50% of the time
- Returns come from a few large-magnitude winners
- **Implication:** High-conviction ideas deserve materially larger position sizes
- Focus on asymmetric payoffs: limited downside, massive upside

## V. The Four Sources of Edge (BAIT)

To generate excess returns, you MUST have edge. There are only four types:

### 1. Behavioral Edge
Exploit collective cognitive errors:
- **Over-extrapolation:** Market assumes recent past continues indefinitely
- **Recency bias:** Recent events weighted too heavily
- **Wisdom → Madness:** Crowds fail when diversity collapses, aggregation breaks, or incentives misalign

**Check:** Is the market making a systematic psychological error?

### 2. Analytical Edge
Superior interpretive frameworks:
- Better unit economics models
- Seeing second-order effects others miss
- Correctly weighting information (linchpins vs. noise)
- **Warning:** More information → higher confidence WITHOUT better accuracy. Focus on the 2-3 key drivers.

**Check:** Do you have a better model for interpreting public data?

### 3. Informational Edge
Overlooked or alternative data:
- **Limited attention:** Complex situations are hard for markets to process quickly
- Supplier/customer filings
- Alternative data (job postings, reviews, foot traffic)
- **Not inside information** - public but under-analyzed

**Check:** Are you using information the market isn't attending to?

### 4. Technical Edge
Non-fundamental price distortions:
- **Leverage cycle:** Forced selling during deleveraging
- Index rebalancing flows
- Principal-agent issues (fund redemptions forcing sales)
- Spin-offs, merger arb
- **Key:** Requires access to capital when others are forced to sell

**Check:** Is price disconnected from fundamentals due to mechanical flows?

## VI. Base Rates & Regression to the Mean

**Before building a bottom-up forecast, consult the "outside view."**

### Corporate Metrics Regress:
- High ROIC companies → trend toward industry average
- High-growth companies → growth rates decline
- Extreme margins → normalize over time

### Application:
1. **Anchor your forecast:** "X% of companies sustaining 30%+ ROIC did so for 5+ years"
2. **Reality-check market:** If price implies exceptional performance, state how exceptional it truly is
3. **The Base Rate Book:** Quantifies mean reversion speeds for sales, margins, ROIC

**Warning:** Don't just use industry averages - find specific comparable situations (base rate reference class).

---

## VII. Linchpins & Information Discipline

**The 2-3 variables that drive 80% of thesis value.**

### Rules:
1. **Identify linchpins early** - What are the critical drivers?
2. **Resist marginal information** - Once linchpins are clear, gathering more data increases confidence without improving accuracy
3. **Focus ruthlessly** - More factors ≠ better forecast

**Good linchpin:** "European churn rate must stay <4% (vs. market assuming 6%)"
**Bad linchpin:** "Revenue growth, margins, execution, competition, macro"

---

## VIII. Active Management Arithmetic

**Sharpe's Law:** Before costs, average active dollar = average passive dollar. After costs, active < passive.

### Implications:
1. **You must have edge** - See BAIT framework
2. **Dispersion is necessary** - Skill can only express when return dispersion exists
3. **Market timing is near-impossible** - Focus on security selection, not macro calls
4. **Pre-fee alpha exists** - Our job is extracting it efficiently

---

## IX. Key Mental Models

### 1. Efficiently Inefficient Markets
Markets are efficient enough that beating them is hard, but inefficient enough that skill can prevail with edge.

### 2. Sample Size & Luck
More luck in activity → larger sample needed to prove skill. Be patient with process.

### 3. Falsifiability
Every thesis must have **specific, quantified outcomes** that would prove it wrong. No unfalsifiable narratives.

### 4. Multidisciplinary Thinking
Draw from psychology (biases), competitive strategy (Porter's 5 Forces), complexity theory (emergence), probability (Bayesian updating).

---

## X. Practical Disciplines

### Always:
- ✓ Calculate FCF and FCF conversion (not just EPS)
- ✓ Adjust ROIC for intangibles when applicable
- ✓ Document your decision process (for later review)
- ✓ Establish falsifiable signposts with probabilities
- ✓ Identify your edge (BAIT) explicitly

### Never:
- ✗ Confuse good companies with good investments
- ✗ State a price target without showing methodology
- ✗ Use growth below cost of capital as bullish
- ✗ Gather information beyond linchpin needs
- ✗ Judge a process by a single outcome

---

## Summary: The Mauboussin Mindset

1. **Seek mispricings, not good businesses**
2. **Value is future FCF, period**
3. **Process > outcome**
4. **Magnitude > frequency** (Babe Ruth)
5. **You must have edge** (BAIT)
6. **Base rates anchor forecasts**
7. **Focus on 2-3 linchpins, ignore the rest**
8. **Always be falsifiable**

Internalize these. They are not optional perspectives—they are the foundation of disciplined investing.
