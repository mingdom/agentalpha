Guide for AI Agents

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `agent/` holds finalized analyst personas and reporting templates such as `agent/maub-analyst/mm-analyst.md`; treat each subfolder as a stable reference point.
- `inbox/` stores incoming prompt drafts or source ideas (e.g., `inbox/grok-rankings.md`), so organize future prompts by topic and timestamp for easy triage.
- Root is intentionally lean; contributions generally add or adjust Markdown assets, so keep the directory tree flat unless a new logical grouping emerges.
