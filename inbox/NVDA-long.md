NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) - LONG - 12-18moFair Value: $225 (prob-weighted) | Current: $190 | Upside: +18% | Conviction: Moderate1. Thesis & Expectations GapThe "Mid-Cycle" Mispricing: Duration Over MagnitudeNVIDIA is currently trading at an inflection point where the market fears a "Cisco 2000" infrastructure peak. At ~$190/share (~36x LTM Sales), the market is pricing in a near-term deceleration—essentially betting that the Hyperscaler capex cycle (currently ~$160B annualized among the "Big 4") faces an imminent air pocket in 2026 as training models plateau.Market Expectation: The market prices NVDA as a cyclical hardware stock at peak earnings. The consensus view implies revenue growth decelerating from 56% (Q2 FY26) to <30% by FY27, assuming the "training" phase of AI is a one-time infrastructure build-out that will soon face utilization headwinds.Our Variant View: We believe the market underestimates the duration of this cycle, not just the magnitude. Our analysis suggests the shift from "Training" to "Inference" (Blackwell's primary unit economic advantage) effectively resets the install base opportunity. We forecast FY27 earnings power of ~$6.50/share (vs consensus ~$6.02) because:Inference Jevons Paradox: Lower inference costs via Blackwell unlock dormant demand in agentic AI (high-volume reasoning), replacing sporadic human queries with continuous machine-to-machine transactions.Sovereign & Enterprise Layer: Demand is diversifying away from the "Big 4" CSPs (Concentration risk decreasing from ~45% to <35% over 18 months) as Sovereign AI and Tier-2 clouds (CoreWeave, Lambda) enter the "deployment" phase.Valuation Summary: Our probability-weighted fair value of $225 implies 18% upside. This is driven by a Base Case DCF assuming a 25% revenue CAGR through FY28 (vs market implied ~18%) and a terminal FCF margin of 45%.2. Source of Edge (BAIT)Primary Edge: Analytical (Unit Economics & Duration)The Market Miss: The market is analyzing NVDA using a "Hardware Cycle" framework (boom/bust based on shipment volume). This ignores the software-like lock-in of the CUDA ecosystem combined with the accelerated cadence of product releases (Rubin following Blackwell).Evidence: Historical hardware cycles (Cisco, Intel) died when customers sweated assets for 5-7 years. NVDA has compressed the product cycle to 1 year. Hyperscalers cannot sweat Hopper H100s when Blackwell B200s offer 30x inference performance (energy/token) for only ~40% higher TCO. The obsolescence risk forces continued capex, decoupling NVDA revenue from end-user utility rates in the short term.Who is Wrong: Bears arguing "Circular Financing" (startups buying chips with VC money) are missing that >80% of demand is now inference-driven or strategic defense by well-capitalized Mega-Caps, not speculative startup demand.3. Linchpins (2-3 Key Drivers)Linchpin 1: Blackwell Supply Chain & ASP UpliftOur View: Blackwell ASPs (Average Selling Prices) will drive a +15% blended pricing uplift in Data Center. We expect Data Center revenue to cross $50B in Q4 FY26 (vs consensus $48B).Market View: Fear of "air pocket" transition from Hopper to Blackwell causing a revenue dip or margin compression due to HBM3e yield issues.Rationale: Supply is the only constraint. Every B200 produced is already allocated. The "yield issues" are a known quantity that simply pushes revenue into Q1 FY27, extending the backlog visibility.Linchpin 2: FCF Conversion & Quality of EarningsOur View: FY26 FCF conversion will normalize to >80% of Net Income. Q2 FY26 saw a dip (FCF/Net Income ~51%) solely due to an $8.1B tax timing payment.Market View: Skepticism on earnings quality due to the divergence between Net Income ($26.4B) and OCF ($15.4B) in Q2.Rationale: Adjusting for the tax payment, OCF was ~$23.5B. The business remains incredibly capital efficient (requires minimal tangible capital to scale revenue).4.

Pre-Mortem & RisksFor this thesis to be wrong:The "Circular Financing" Unwind (Risk: High): If the "Revenue → VC Investment → Cloud Spend → Revenue" loop breaks.Probability: 30%Mitigation: We monitor the "RPO" (Remaining Performance Obligations) of non-CSP customers.Thermal/Power Wall (Risk: Moderate): Data centers literally cannot power the Blackwell racks (120kW/rack).Probability: 40%Mitigation: NVDA is pivoting to liquid cooling (GB200 NVL72), capturing more rack value, but deployment delays could flatten the revenue curve.6. Fair Value AnalysisPrimary Valuation Method: 10-Year DCFReasoning: Multiples are useless at this growth velocity. We must assess the cash flow durability of the terminal state.Key Assumptions (Base Case):Revenue CAGR (5-yr): 20% (fading from 50% to 10%).Terminal FCF Margin: 45% (down from current ~50% peak to reflect competition).WACC: 9.5% (Higher beta to reflect semi-cyclicality).Tax Rate: 16.5% (Management guidance).Scenario Analysis:ScenarioProbabilityKey AssumptionsFair ValueBear25%"Cisco Crash": Growth halts in 2026. 5% CAGR.
